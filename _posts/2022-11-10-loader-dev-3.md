In this post, we will go over techniques to avoid hooks placed into memory by an EDR. 

## Disclaimer
These posts are done as a reference for myself and to gain a deeper understanding of the discussed topics by explaining them in a blog post. 

The techniques used here are not novel and were documented by other people before. Therefore the use of these posts for threat actors will likely be minimal. Nonetheless, I decided against releasing a full PoC implementation and will instead only provide code snippets as part of the posts. All of the credit should go to the people, that did the original research on the techniques used. 

## Hooks
We will start by discussing how hooks work as background information for the later sections in which we will circumvent them.

### IAT Hooks
One way to hook functions is to replace the address of the function in the Import Address Table (IAT) with the address of the hooking logic. If our executable then uses the IAT to resolve a function it will invoke the hooking logic instead. This is however less relevant for our purposes here, as we are not using the IAT for our function resolution. My understanding is, that most EDRs are preferring Trampoline hooks over IAT hooks. We will discuss trampoline hooks in the next section.

### Inline/Trampoline hooks
Instead of hooking the IAT, we can also overwrite the start of a function with a jump to our hooking logic. If the function is then called the jump to our logic is executed first and we can analyze the function call before handing over execution to the original logic. The following figure shows this:

![](/assets/jmp_hook_drawing.png)

### Hooks in the real world
So let's have a short look at how this looks in the real world. For this, we will use an unnamed EDR, which hooks certain functions. One hooked function is `NtCreateThread`. Let us first look at this function without the hook in place:
![](/assets/NtCreateThread_without_hook.png)

With the hook in place the function looks as follows:
![](/assets/NtCreateThread_with_hook.png)

As we can see there is an unconditional jump added at the start of the functions. In this case, the rest of the space is filled with `int3` instructions. Note that there are more instructions in the second screenshot, as instructions can differ in size on Intel architectures. The jump will allow the EDR to analyze our function call and its argument before doing the actual `NtCreateThread` syscall.

## Avoiding hooks
Now that we have covered how EDR products might hook certain functions we will start discussing how to avoid these hooks.

### Moving to lower-level functions
In many cases, the functions documented by Microsoft and used by most programmers like `VirtualProtect` are a wrapper to lower-level functions, that provide a more convenient and stable interface to the lower-level functions. With `VirtualProtect` the actual call stack when interacting with the kernel, which changes the protections, is as follows:

![](/assets/callstack_virtualprotect.png)

As we can see we could also use the `NtProtectVirtualMemory` function directly instead of `VirtualProtect`. Note that we are sacrificing some convenience here and that undocumented functions might be changed by Microsoft at any point.

In the past, some EDRs did only hook functions at a higher level. Therefore it was possible to avoid hooks by calling lower-level functions directly. By now hooks are in most cases also placed in `ntdll.dll` which is the interface between user space and the kernel. Therefore it is generally no longer possible to avoid hooks by moving to lower-level functions.

### Loading a second copy 
Another strategy to avoid hooks is to load another copy of the used DLL into memory and then use the second copy for our calls. However, this has the disadvantage, that loading the copy into memory might itself already be detected and deemed malicious. Therefore if we do not have a way to do this without encountering hooks this might not work. It also leaves the obvious indicator of compromise, that there are e.g. two copies of `ntdll.dll` loaded. 

### Direct syscalls
Functions in `ntdll.dll` are mostly just a wrapper to `syscall` instructions, which place the appropriate syscall number into the `rax` register and hand over control to the kernel. We can see this in the following screenshot, which shows the `NtProtectVirtualMemory` function:
![](/assets/NtProtectVirtualMemory_instructions.png)

We can replicate this by using our syscall instruction with the right syscall number. Therefore the next step here is to find the syscall number for the syscall we want to do.

#### Hardcoding the syscall numbers
One way to gather the syscall numbers is to look at the `ntdll.dll` file and create a mapping between the function we want to invoke and the syscall number. Sadly the syscall numbers depend on the build of Windows and we can therefore only hardcode them when we know the specific version of Windows we are targeting. This is done e.g. by [SysWhispers](https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers).

#### Parsing ntdll.dll dynamically
We could also parse the syscall numbers from the `ntdll.dll` present on the system, which would then be the right numbers for the targeted build version. One way to do this is to use the copy already mapped into memory to retrieve the syscall number, as is done by [HellsGate](https://github.com/vxunderground/VXUG-Papers/tree/main/Hells%20Gate). Here however we again face the problem, that this copy might be hooked and therefore might no longer contain our syscall numbers. 

We could also retrieve a clean copy of `ntdll.dll` from disk. However opening a fresh copy of `ntdll.dll` might be suspicious and get detected by the EDR, as we are using the hooked logic to open the file.

As with unhooking (which we will look at later in this post) an alternative way here could be to create a suspended process and read the clean copy of e.g. `ntdll.dll` from its memory before an EDR had the opportunity to place its hooks in memory. Again the main issue here is, that we would use potentially hooked functions here and therefore might be detected.

#### Using function order in memory
Fortunately, we can also dynamically find the syscall numbers by relying on the order of the syscalls in memory. The syscall numbers are sequential in memory as can be seen in the following screenshot: 
![](syscall_order.png)

As you can see the functions located after each other in memory also have sequential syscall numbers (0x4c-0x50).

There are two strategies, that I am aware of, that use this order to retrieve the syscall numbers. The first one is `Halo's Gate`, which I learned about in the course material from [Sektor7](https://institute.sektor7.net/rto-win-evasion). The idea here is basically `Hell's Gate`, but instead of parsing the syscall number from the copy in memory and stopping if a hook overwrote the syscalls number we are continuing our search in the function above and below the function we want to retrieve the syscall number for. The offset to these is always 32 bytes and if we find their syscall numbers we can use the current offset used in our search to calculate the syscall number we are searching for. 

One disadvantage of `Halo's Gate` is that we still need to find a syscall number in memory. While this is likely possible as not all functions will be hooked it could still be prevented by an EDR, that hooks all functions in `ntdll.dll`. Instead, we can use the method used by [FreshyCalls](https://github.com/crummie5/FreshyCalls) (this is a fork as I did not find the original repo). The basic idea here is that we sort all function names by their address in memory. Afterward, we can search our function name and will be able to use the index to our sorted function list as the syscall number. As we are not relying on reading the syscall address from memory this should even work if they have all been removed from memory as long as the ordering does not change (which is not a given, as Microsoft could change this with every update). As this is one method I decided to port to C we will cover this in a bit more detail here.

Like `FreshyCalls` I defined a struct, that contains the mapping between the syscall name and address:
```
// Struct holding the syscall name and its address
struct SYSCALL_ENTRY {
	char* name;
	DWORD address;
};

// Struct holding the number of found syscalls, as well as the ntdll.dll base address and an array of SYSCALL_ENTRY structs
struct SYSCALL_LIST {
	DWORD size;
	char* pBaseAddress;
	struct SYSCALL_ENTRY entries[MAX_SYSCALL_ENTRIES];
};
```

We then fill this initially with all functions in `ntdll.dll` (see part 2 for a more detailed description), that start with `nt`, but not with `ntdll` (ignoring case):
```
DWORD* Functions = (DWORD*)(pBaseAddr + pExportDirAddr->AddressOfFunctions);
DWORD* Names = (DWORD*)(pBaseAddr + pExportDirAddr->AddressOfNames);
WORD* Ordinals = (WORD*)(pBaseAddr + pExportDirAddr->AddressOfNameOrdinals);

DWORD j = 0;
for (DWORD i=0; i < pExportDirAddr->NumberOfNames; i++) {
	char* FunctionName = pBaseAddr + Names[i];
	if([...]) { // Starts with nt, but not ntdll
		syscall_list.entries[j].name = FunctionName;
		syscall_list.entries[j].address = Functions[Ordinals[i]];
		j++;
	}
}
syscall_list.size = j;
syscall_list.pBaseAddress = pBaseAddr;
```

Finally, we will sort all of the entries by their address:
```
for (unsigned long i = 0; i < syscall_list.size - 1; i++) {
	for (unsigned long j = 0; j < syscall_list.size - i - 1; j++) {
		if (syscall_list.entries[j].address > syscall_list.entries[j + 1].address) {
			// Swap entries.
			struct SYSCALL_ENTRY TempEntry = {};
			TempEntry.name = syscall_list.entries[j].name;
			TempEntry.address = syscall_list.entries[j].address;
			syscall_list.entries[j].name = syscall_list.entries[j + 1].name;
			syscall_list.entries[j].address = syscall_list.entries[j + 1].address;
			syscall_list.entries[j + 1].name = TempEntry.name;
			syscall_list.entries[j + 1].address = TempEntry.address;
		}
	}

}
```

The index, where our function is located is now the syscall number, that we searching so we can iterate over our structure as follows and return the syscall number when we find our function:
```
for (DWORD i=0; i < syscall_list.size; i++) {
	if ( strcmp(syscall_name, syscall_list.entries[i].name)== 0) {
		return i;
	}
}
```

#### Using Vectored Exception Handling
Another option would be to call our syscall using non-malicious arguments with the hooks in place so that no detection is triggered. Before doing the call we set a breakpoint at the syscall instruction and use Vectored Exception Handling to handle this breakpoint. Even if the EDR has removed the syscall number from the `ntdll.dll` memory it will be placed in EAX before the syscall. So when our exception is triggered to the right syscall number will be in EAX and we can retrieve it. This is described by [rad98](https://twitter.com/rad9800) in [this blog post](https://fool.ish.wtf/2022/08/tamperingsyscalls.html).

#### Doing the syscall
Using the syscall number we can replicate the behavior of the function present in `ntdll.dll`. For this `SysWhispers` does ship a syscall instruction. This, however, seems like an easy pattern, that AV software could check for, as there is no reason to use this instruction in an executable and it should only be present in `ntdll.dll` is my understanding. Instead, we can use a gadget from `ntdll.dll`, which our code jumps to perform the actual syscall as done by `FreshyCalls`. This has the additional advantage of the call originating from `ntdll.dll`, which could be beneficial if the call stack is checked by an EDR in the kernel.

For this purpose, I implemented logic, that searches `ntdll.dll` for a `syscall` instruction. We can start at the address of our target function and then search for a syscall instruction as follows:

```
for(int i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
	if(*( function_base_address + i) == 0x0F && *(function_base_address + i +1) == 0x05) {
		return (unsigned char*) (function_base_address + i);
	}
}
```

This is not a clean solution, as we are relying on the fact, that the instructions are present either in our function or in one of the functions located directly afterward. It would be cleaner to search specifically in our function and then start at the beginning of the `.text` segment so that we will find a `syscall` instruction when there is one present. Changing this is still on my TODO list. 

As the loader uses MinGW we can use the following code to store our syscall gadget and the syscall number in the needed registries:
```
register unsigned char* syscall_gadget asm("r11") = tmp_syscall_gadget;
register unsigned int syscall_number asm("rax") = tmp_syscall_number;
```

Afterward, we can use the following assembly stub to execute the syscall:
```
// At the beginning of our function we ensure, that all arguments are saved on the stack (assuming stdcall calling convention)
// Here we put them into registers again, as our logic will likely have clobbered the original values
movq 0x10(%rbp), %rcx // restore first argument
movq 0x18(%rbp), %rdx // restore second argument
movq 0x20(%rbp), %r8 // restore third argument
movq 0x28(%rbp), %r9 // restore fourth argument. Everything after this is passed on the stack anyway.

mov %rcx, %r10\n\t" // replicate normal syscall stub behaviour
mov %rbp,%rsp \n\t" // get rid of local variables, which we no longer need
pop %rbp \n\t" // restore base pointer
jmp %r11 \n\t" // jmp to our gadget
```

This logic makes some assumptions on how our compiler implements the function (e.g. that rbp is stored on the stack). I verified, that this is indeed the case in my implementation. However future versions of the compiler or different implementations might need some adjustments here.

As we are directly calling the syscall from our code, which will not have been hooked by the EDR this avoids any hooks that might have been placed in user space.

### Unhooking

Using direct syscalls is often inconvenient and might lead to a lot of maintenance, as these interfaces might change at any time. Therefore we should keep our usage of direct syscalls to a minimum. Furthermore, the payload we load will likely use the Windows APIs, which an EDR will still have hooked at this point.

The hooks will likely be placed by the EDR during the initialization of our process or when a new library is loaded. As discussed before these hooks are most likely trampoline hooks, which are placed at the beginning of the targeted functions. As the functions reside in userspace we can overwrite them ourselves, too. This means, that we can revert the changes made by the EDR to the function instruction, which is basically what we will be doing when unhooking our process.

### IAT Unhooking

As discussed initially one way to hook functions is by overwriting function addresses in the IAT. Because this seemed less relevant I decided against integrating this for now. If you are searching for inspiration there is [this](https://github.com/xalicex/Unhook-Import-Address-Table) project, which implements IAT unhooking. There is also an accompanying [blog post](https://alice.climent-pommeret.red/posts/how-and-why-to-unhook-the-import-address-table/), that I highly recommend, which explains what we are doing. To summarize the post we would iterate over the IAT and recalculate the function addresses by looking at the Export Address Table (EAT) of the DLL implementing the function. If the function address differs we then overwrite the presumably hooked address with our newly calculated one.

## Removing inline hooks

To remove inline hooks we first need access to a clean version of the DLL. We can retrieve a clean version of the DLL from the original file on disk, as the DLLs are only hooked during runtime. Another option would be to start a suspended process and retrieve a clean version of the loaded DLLs before the EDR had the opportunity to hook the DLLs. For DLLs included as `\KnownDlls\` it is also an option to call `NtOpenSection` to get a section handle, which can then be used to map the DLL into our process. The `\KnownDlls\` entries are a caching mechanism for the more important DLLs used by the system and this technique works e.g. for `ntdll.dll`. 

After we have a clean copy of our target DLL we then use it to remove any hooks from the `.text` section of the DLL loaded by our process. The simplest way to do this is to overwrite the complete text section with the clean version. This works well for `ntdll.dll`, but I am not sure if it is the best approach for other DLLs. A more fine-grained approach is to check if a hook is in place for each function and then only overwrite the hook if it is actually in place.

The implementation in my case was heavily inspired by [this code](https://github.com/cube0x0/SyscallPack/blob/main/SyscallPack/unhook-PIC.c), as this seemed to be the simplest way to archive the unhooking using only direct syscalls. It uses the `\KnwonDlls\` path and checks for a `jmp` at the beginning of each function to evaluate if a certain function is hooked. If this is the case the start of the function is overwritten with the instructions from the clean version of the DLL. I decided to only unhook `kernel32.dll`, `kernelbase.dll`, and `ntdll.dll`. In a future version of the loader, it might be nice to unhook all loaded DLLs. However, I suspect, that with these three DLLs most of the hooks encountered in practice should be covered.

After we have executed this we should no longer have hooks in our loaded DLLs and therefore should be harder to detect even when using functions provided by the loaded DLLs instead of direct syscalls. Note, however, that the removal of hooks itself might be an indicator of malicious intent and therefore we need to evaluate whether or not unhooking makes sense in our use case.

### Dynamic unhooking
While looking into this topic I found an [implementation of dynamic unhooking](https://github.com/mgeeky/UnhookMe) by [@mgeeky](https://twitter.com/mariuszbit). The idea here is that instead of unhooking the DLLs we consider relevant at the beginning of our execution we integrate the unhooking logic into our dynamic function resolution logic (see [part 2](Blogpost_2022-Loader_Implementation_Part_2_Dynamic_Function_Resolution.md) of this series). This way we can dynamically unhook only the functions we use, which should be a lot stealthier. This will make it harder to check if the hooks are still in place, as most hooks will still be in place. Therefore this seems like a great idea. However, as our payload is not aware of our dynamic function resolution logic this seems less relevant for developing a loader than e.g. for a custom C2 framework. To make this work within a loader we would need to ensure, that the payload uses this dynamic function resolution logic, which does not seem trivial and which I, therefore, decide against.

## Kernel level detections
The hooks placed by the EDR we discussed until now are located in user space. There is however also the possibility, that the logic detecting us resides in kernel space. These could then e.g. detect our direct syscalls or our function call after we removed the hooks.

### Kernel Callbacks
Drivers can register callbacks for some events in the kernel like the creation of a new process. An EDR, that ships with a kernel driver could register such a callback and react to the event. There was a [non-comprehesive list](https://codemachine.com/articles/kernel_callback_functions.html) of kernel callbacks linked in [this](https://pre.empt.dev/posts/maelstrom-edr-kernel-callbacks-hooks-and-callstacks/) awesome series on C2 development. 

### ETW TI
Another component in the kernel, that might still lead to detection is ETW TI. This is a component implemented by Microsoft and therefore heavily used by their EDR, while other EDRs are to the best of my knowledge just starting to use it. It is a version of ETW, that is implemented in the kernel and logs information about events triggered by a process. I found [this blog post](https://undev.ninja/introduction-to-threat-intelligence-etw/) helpful for gaining a bit more insight into ETW TI.

### Call Stack Spoofing
One thing, that an EDR could look at to detect direct syscalls or the malicious use of functions is to look at the call stack of the call. If the call stack does not contain the expected calls or contains suspicious addresses, that for example are not backed by a file, then this could lead to detection. 

To avoid this there are multiple projects. There is for example [an implementation](https://github.com/mgeeky/ThreadStackSpoofer) by [mgeeky](https://twitter.com/mariuszbit), that places a 0 into the call stack of a sleeping thread to stop the unwinding process. There is also this [blog post](https://labs.withsecure.com/blog/spoofing-call-stacks-to-confuse-edrs), which discusses spoofing a call stack using a new thread to make an unsuspicious syscall. [AceLdr](https://github.com/kyleavery/AceLdr), which uses a `jmp` gadget to avoid calls from a suspicious location.

### EDR Sandblast
[EDR Sandblast](https://github.com/wavestone-cdt/EDRSandblast) is a tool, that uses a vulnerable driver to execute code in the kernel. It then can remove any kernel callbacks and also deactivate ETW TI. The tool is quite powerful and has other features. However, Microsoft is starting to lock down the loading of drivers by requiring them to be signed and by introducing a blacklist for vulnerable drivers. Therefore if the target system is sufficiently hardened we might need our driver or an exploitable zero-day in another driver to use a similar approach.

## Summary
In this post, we briefly discussed how hooks work. We then discussed how to evade them using direct syscalls. Here we covered different options for resolving syscall numbers. Then we discussed unhooking, which will be useful to ensure, that our payload stays undetected during execution, as these hooks would likely allow an EDR solution to recognize some of our payloads by their call patterns. In the next post, we will discuss evading AMSI and ETW to ensure that our payload is even harder to detect during runtime.
