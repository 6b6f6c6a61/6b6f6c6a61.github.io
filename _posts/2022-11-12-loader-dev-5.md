In this post, we will finally cover loading our actual payload. As discussed at the beginning of this series my loader should be able to load shellcode, C# assemblies as well as PEs. The actual mode will be chosen using an argument to the python script used for compilation.

## Disclaimer
These posts are done as a reference for myself and to gain a deeper understanding of the discussed topics by explaining them in a blog post. 

The techniques used here are not novel and were documented by other people before. Therefore the use of these posts for threat actors will likely be minimal. Nonetheless, I decided against releasing a full PoC implementation and will instead only provide code snippets as part of the posts. All of the credit should go to the people, that did the original research on the techniques used. 

## Payloads

We will only cover injecting into our current process in this post. There might be one more post on injecting the shellcode into a remote process after this if I find the time to work on it.

There are three forms our payload can take here:
- Shellcode
- C# assmblies
- PEs

For each, the loading works differently and therefore we will cover each format in a separate section. In each section, I will give a brief explanation of the technique as well as references where to look for more information. Then we will look at a short PoC and the detections for the payload on antiscan.me to test the effectiveness of our loader. 

## Shellcode (Phantom DLL Hollowing)
For loading shellcode Phantom DLL Hollowing is used. A detailed description of this technique can be found [here](https://www.forrest-orr.net/post/malicious-memory-artifacts-part-i-dll-hollowing) and implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/forrest-orr/phantom-dll-hollower-poc/blob/master/PhantomDllHollower/PhantomDllHollower.cpp). 

The advantage of this technique is how the shellcode looks in memory. In almost all cases instructions executed by a process stem from a file on disk. This could be an executable or a DLL. To understand the advantage of this technique let's first look at the standard case where we load our shellcode into memory, mark the memory as executable and then execute the shellcode. For this, I used a basic loader and shellcode, that pops a message box. The following screenshot shows the memory in Process Hacker in this case:
![](/assets/typical_memory_allocation.png)

This is very different from the memory of e.g. a DLL which can be seen in the following screenshot:
![](/assets/dll_memory_allocation.png)

As we can see such memory is normally file-backed and therefore executable memory, that is not backed by a file can be a red flag during memory scanning.

This brings us to the second option, which is DLL Hollowing. Here instead of allocating memory for our shellcode, we overwrite memory that contains the instructions of a DLL and therefore our shellcode is now in file-backed memory. We can see this in the following screenshot: 
![](/assets/dll_hollowing_memory.png)

This time our shellcode executes from the memory of the `aadauthhelper.dll` DLL and is therefore located in file-backed memory. Note, however, that we now have an entry under `Private WS` in the section marked as executable, which was not the case before. This is because there is now a data section in this area, that is not shared with other processes, but unique to the current process as we have overwritten the memory in this area. This again is a fact, that a memory scanner might look for.

The main difference between DLL Hollowing and Phantom DLL Hollowing is the existence of this private memory. With Phantom DLL Hollowing, we open a DLL file and use transacted file operations to write our shellcode to the file without actually writing it to disk. Afterward, we can map this file into memory and in this case, we do not have any private memory. We can see this in the following screenshot:

![](/assets/phantom_dll_hollowing_memory.png)

Therefore we have eliminated another indicator, that a memory scanner might use to detect our payload using this technique.

The following screenshot shows the loader invoking Metasploit shellcode, which executes a command to open a calculator:

To get further information on the effectiveness of the loader I also uploaded it to antiscan.me:

## Loading .NET
As far as I know, there seems to be one main technique used for loading C# assemblies from unmanaged code without storing it on disk (if this is wrong please tell me). This technique hosts a CLR in the current process and then uses a legacy interface to load the assembly into memory. This way is used e.g. by [donut](https://github.com/TheWover/donut/blob/master/loader/inmem_dotnet.c)., which I took heavy inspiration from. For more details please refer to this implementation.

It is probably pretty suspicious to host a CLR in our process. Another approach, that I never got around to implementing would be to inject into a process, that already has a CLR loaded and reuse the CLR in the remote process. [This](https://github.com/med0x2e/ExecuteAssembly) project seems to implement this.

The following screenshot shows the loader running [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) :

Again I uploaded the file to antiscan.me to assess the effectiveness:

## RunPE
When loading a PE into memory we need to mimic the behavior of the load process done by Windows internally and resolve all dependencies. There are multiple implementations, that inspired my implementation. One implementation is by Netitude in C#. There is also an accompanying white paper. There is also a C++ implementation [here](https://github.com/aaaddress1/RunPE-In-Memory) and a Nim implementation [here]().  

My aim here was to create an implementation, that gets a decrypted PE passed to it as an argument, loads this PE, and then runs it. As this is intended as a loader and not as part of a C2 framework I am less concerned about the cleanup process. The process will simply exit after executing the PE. This differs from the C# implementation done by Netitude. I also do not need to be able to load existing PEs from disk, as I am primarily trying to hide binaries like mimikatz from AV/EDR products and will therefore not put these on disk.

As the loader is implemented in C I took the basic implementation from the  [C++ implementation](https://github.com/aaaddress1/RunPE-In-Memory)  mentioned above. There are a few adjustments in my version:
- Fine-grained permissions instead of RWX
- Direct syscalls where feasible
- Support for 64bit relocations

Let us go over these changes one by one. The initial memory allocation in the original implementation was done using `RWX` permissions, which is quite suspicious in my opinion. The needed permissions for each section are present in the `Characteristics` field in each section header. We therefore can look them up for each of the sections and then change the protections accordingly. My implementation is allocating memory with `RW`  permissions initially and then adjusting the permissions before executing the PE.  The following code is ported from the Netitude implementation:
```
IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER * SectionHeaderArr = (IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER *)((size_t)ntHeader + sizeof(IMAGE_NT_HEADERS));
for (int i = 0; i < ntHeader->FileHeader.NumberOfSections; i++) {
	printf(" [+] Changing the protections for Section %s\n", SectionHeaderArr[i].Name);
	bool execute = ((unsigned int) SectionHeaderArr[i].Characteristics & IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE) != 0;
	bool read = ((unsigned int) SectionHeaderArr[i].Characteristics & IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ) != 0;
	bool write = ((unsigned int) SectionHeaderArr[i].Characteristics & IMAGE_SCN_MEM_WRITE) != 0;
	DWORD32 protection = PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE;
	if (execute && read && write) {
		protection = PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE;
	}
	else if (!execute && read && write) {
		protection = PAGE_READWRITE;
	}
	else if (!write && execute && read) {
		protection = PAGE_EXECUTE_READ;
	}
	else if (!execute && !write && read) {
		protection = PAGE_READONLY;
	}
	else if (execute && !read && !write) {
		protection = PAGE_EXECUTE;
	}
	else if (!execute && !read && !write){
		protection = PAGE_NOACCESS;
	}
	printf(" [+] Setting protection: 0x%x\n", protection);
	DWORD old_protect = 0;
	LPVOID base_address = (LPVOID)(pImageBase + SectionHeaderArr[i].VirtualAddress);
	size_t data_size = SectionHeaderArr[i].SizeOfRawData;
	NTSTATUS status = pNtProtectVirtualMemory((HANDLE)-1, &base_address, &data_size , protection, &old_protect);
}
```

Furthermore, I also replaced the function calls with direct syscalls to give fewer detection opportunities to EDRs. As we already discussed direct syscalls before I won't go into details here.

Then I added support for 64-bit relocations. This was not a huge change, as these are similar to the 32-bit version. However, the original version just gives up when facing 64bit relocations. The case, that I added to the original code looked as follows:
```
else if (type == RELOC_64BIT_FIELD) {
	// Get relocation address location
	size_t* relocateAddr = (size_t*)((size_t)modulePtr + reloc_field);
	printf(" [V] Apply Reloc Field at %x\n", relocateAddr);
	*(UINT64 *)relocateAddr = ((*relocateAddr) - oldBase + newBase);
}
```

Apart from this, I did the usual modifications like dynamically resolving functions and encrypting strings.

One other change, that I thought about was to do a custom `LoadLibrary` version as done [here](https://github.com/bats3c/DarkLoadLibrary). This should help get around kernel-level logic, that might recognize our loading of DLLs as suspicious. This will get more important as EDRs move towards processing ETW TI logs and registering more kernel callbacks.

Again I also uploaded it to antiscan.me:

## Summary
In this post, we discussed the different techniques for loading our payload depending on the kind of payload we are loading and gave some pointers to resources, that can be used to reproduce this. We also tested the loader against some security vendors and saw that our implementation seems to work quite well.

Two tasks that are still open at this point are implementing remote injection logic and converting parts of the loader to position-independent code. If I get around to it I will do one more blog post on these topics.
