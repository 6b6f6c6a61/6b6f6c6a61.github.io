In this post, we discuss dynamically resolving functions, which helps avoid static detections based on the functions imported by our executable.

## Disclaimer
These posts are done as a reference for myself and to gain a deeper understanding of the discussed topics by explaining them in a blog post. 

The techniques used here are not novel and were documented by other people before. Therefore the use of these posts for threat actors will likely be minimal. Nonetheless, I decided against releasing a full PoC implementation and will instead only provide code snippets as part of the posts. All of the credits should go to the people, that did the original research on the techniques used. 

## Imports
The functions our executable uses are by default easily viewable in the imports section of our executable. The following code could be used in a basic loader:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>

int main() {
  unsigned char shellcode[] = [...];
  unsigned char* base_address = VirtualAlloc(NULL, sizeof(shellcode), MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
  memcpy(base_address, shellcode, sizeof(shellcode));
  ((void(WINAPI*)(void))base_address)();
}
```

After compilation, we can view the imports of our executable e.g. using [PE-bear](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-bear-releases):

Note that the `VirtualAlloc` function is imported by our executable. AV solutions consider these imports when evaluating whether or not our executable is malicious. Therefore we should avoid suspicious function imports like the `VirtualAlloc` function.

## Dynamic function resolution
It is possible to dynamically resolve function addresses using the `GetModuleHandle` or `LoadLibraryA` and `GetProcAddress` functions. By using these functions we could avoid importing `VirtualAlloc`:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>

int main() {
  unsigned char shellcode[] = [...];
  unsigned char* base_address = (unsigned char*(WINAPI*)(LPVOID,SIZE_T,DWORD,DWORD))GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle("Kernel32.dll"), "VirtualAlloc")(NULL, sizeof(shellcode), MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);
  memcpy(base_address, shellcode, sizeof(shellcode));
  ((void(WINAPI*)(void))base_address)();
}
```
As can be seen in the following screenshot the `VirtualAlloc` function is  now no longer imported, but the functions used for resolving it will be imported:

These functions themself might be considered suspicious. Therefore it is better to implement a custom version of these functions by parsing the PE structure manually to resolve functions. We will go over this in the following section.

## Custom implementation
In this section, we will cover how to manually resolve a function. As with the `GetModuleHandle` and `GetProcAddress` functions, we will need to know the name of the function and the DLL the function is exported by.  My implementation uses the actual name of the function or DLL. However, there are other implementations out there that use hashes of the DLL and function names instead. This has the advantage, that shipping the function names in our executable might be considered suspicious. Instead of using a hash, I chose to encrypt the strings in the code used by my loader.

### Custom GetModuleHandle()
The first step is to resolve the loaded module using the DLL name. For this, we will first take a look at the [Thread Environment Block](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/ns-winternl-teb) (TEB), which is stored in the GS register on 64bit systems. At offset 0x60 there is a pointer to the [Process Environment Block](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/ns-winternl-peb) (PEB) located in the TEB. 
```
typedef struct _TEB {
  PVOID Reserved1[12];
  PPEB  ProcessEnvironmentBlock;
  [...]
} TEB, *PTEB;
```

In the PEB we will find a pointer to a [PEB_LDR_DATA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/ns-winternl-peb_ldr_data) structure:
```
typedef struct _PEB {
  BYTE                          Reserved1[2];
  BYTE                          BeingDebugged;
  BYTE                          Reserved2[1];
  PVOID                         Reserved3[2];
  PPEB_LDR_DATA                 Ldr;
  [..]
} PEB, *PPEB;
```

This structure then contains a list of the modules that are loaded by the current process:
```
typedef struct _PEB_LDR_DATA {
  BYTE       Reserved1[8];
  PVOID      Reserved2[3];
  LIST_ENTRY InMemoryOrderModuleList;
} PEB_LDR_DATA, *PPEB_LDR_DATA;
```

The `LIST_ENTRY` structure is a doubly linked list, which is defined as follows:
```
typedef struct _LIST_ENTRY {
   struct _LIST_ENTRY *Flink;
   struct _LIST_ENTRY *Blink;
} LIST_ENTRY, *PLIST_ENTRY, *RESTRICTED_POINTER PRLIST_ENTRY;
```

Each of these `LIST_ENTRY` structs is part of an `LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY`. The structure provided by Microsoft is as follows:
```
typedef struct _LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY {
    PVOID Reserved1[2];
    LIST_ENTRY InMemoryOrderLinks;
    PVOID Reserved2[2];
    PVOID DllBase;
    PVOID EntryPoint;
    PVOID Reserved3;
    UNICODE_STRING FullDllName;
    BYTE Reserved4[8];
    PVOID Reserved5[3];
    union {
        ULONG CheckSum;
        PVOID Reserved6;
    };
    ULONG TimeDateStamp;
} LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY, *PLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY;
```

However, we can find a more complete structure in the [ProcessHacker source code](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/doc/ntldr_8h_source.html#l00102). Here we see, that directly after the `FullDllName` there is also a `BaseDllName`. My understanding is, that the `FullDllName` should include the full path, while the `BaseDllName` does not and therefore the `BaseDllName` is more convenient for our use case.

We can compare the `BaseDllName` to the module we are searching for and return the `DllBase` field if we found our DLL. If we end at the `LIST_ENTRY` structure we initially found in the PEB, then we have looked at all modules without finding the target DLL and should return `NULL` to indicate, that we have not found the module.

### Custom GetProcAddress()

With the handle to our module, we then can resolve an actual function as `GetProcAddress` would do. Again we will traverse several different structures to find the relevant fields. The first structure we will look at is the `IMAGE_DOS_HEADER` structure. The definition can e.g. be found in the [ReactOS](https://doxygen.reactos.org/da/dda/filesystems_2udfs_2Include_2ntddk__ex_8h_source.html) source code:
```
typedef struct _IMAGE_DOS_HEADER {
	[..]
	LONG e_lfanew; // File address of new exe header
} IMAGE_DOS_HEADER, *PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER;
```

The last field here is named `e_lfanew`  and contains the offset to the `IMAGE_NT_HEADERS` structure, which we need to look at next. My understanding is, that the `IMAGE_DOS_HEADER` structure is a legacy structure and for most purposes, we will move on to the `IMAGE_NT_HEADER`. The [definition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-image_nt_headers32) for this structure looks as follows:
```
typedef struct _IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64 {
    DWORD Signature;
    IMAGE_FILE_HEADER FileHeader;
    IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER64 OptionalHeader;
} IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64, *PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS64;
```

Of interest to us is the `OptionalHeader` field. The [definition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-image_optional_header64) looks as follows:
```
typedef struct _IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER64 {
  [...]
  IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY DataDirectory[IMAGE_NUMBEROF_DIRECTORY_ENTRIES];
} IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER64, *PIMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER64;
```

Here we specifically want to look at the `DataDirectory` field., which is the last field The [definition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-image_data_directory) looks as follows:
```
typedef struct _IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY {
  DWORD VirtualAddress;
  DWORD Size;
} IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY;
```

This is an array and there are multiple entries here, that are at specific offsets. The offset, that is of interest to us is `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT`, which contains the exported functions.  The value contained here is an offset from the base address of our module. Using the base address and this offset we can find the `IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY` structure for which ReactOS again has a [definition](https://doxygen.reactos.org/de/d20/struct__IMAGE__EXPORT__DIRECTORY.html):
```
typedef struct  IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY {
  [...]
  DWORD NumberOfFunctions;
  DWORD NumberOfNames;
  DWORD AddressOfFunctions;
  DWORD AddressOfNames;
  DWORD AddressOfNameOrdinals;
} IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY;
```

The `AddressOfNames`, `AddressOfNameOrdinal`, and `AddressOfFunctions` fields are again an offset from the base address of the module. This is also called a Relative Virtual address (RVA). The `AddressOfNames` field points to an array containing the function names of the exported functions.  The `NumberOfNames` field contains the number of function names, that are contained in this array. We can iterate over these names and compare them to the name of the function we are searching for. If we find our function we can then use the offset we found the name at to locate the ordinal, that belongs to our function, in the  `AddressOfNameOrdinals` array. The ordinal can then be used as an index into the `AddressOfFunctions` array to find the address of our function in most cases allowing us to return the address of the function as `GetProcAddress()` does. 

In some cases, the function is forwarded to another DLL. In our use case here we are looking up the DLL name for our own implementation, so this is somewhat unlikely and we could likely fix it by providing the name of the DLL, that our call gets forwarded to. However, if we want to consider this in our implementation we can recognize this, as the function pointer we retrieve in the final step should in this case point to a string in our `IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY` structure. So we can compare the limits of this structure using the `Size` field from our `IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY` structure with our pointer to see if this is the case and then handle these cases differently.

If the function is forwarded my understanding is, that the address of our functions points to a string of the form `DLLNAME.FUNCTIONNAME`. Therefore we can parse this string and then invoke our logic again with the new DLL and function name.

A full implementation of the discussed logic can e.g. be found in [@C5pider](https://twitter.com/C5pider)'s [KaynLdr](https://github.com/Cracked5pider/KaynLdr/blob/main/KaynLdr/src/Win32.c) .

### Strings
As already mentioned before the strings, that we use to dynamically resolve the used functions can give an indication, that we are trying to hide a suspicious import. We can manually find these strings using the `string` command on Linux:
```
$ strings basic_loader.exe | grep "Virtual"
VirtualAlloc
  VirtualQuery failed for %d bytes at address %p
  VirtualProtect failed with code 0x%x
VirtualProtect
VirtualQuery
	VirtualAddress
VirtualSize
VirtualAddress
VirtualSize
VirtualProtect
VirtualQuery
VirtualAddress
VirtualQuery
VirtualProtect
__imp_VirtualProtect
__imp_VirtualQuery
```

As can be seen, the `VirtualAlloc` function is still visible here and a security product could easily recognize what we are up to. As mentioned before one way to get around this is to use hashes instead of the function name to find the function we want to resolve. However these hashes themself might be an indicator of malicious intent if they are frequently used by malware. Therefore it would be advantageous to use a less known hash algorithm here.

Another option is to encrypt the strings and decrypt them during runtime. This is the route I went in my loader.

## Summary
We discussed imports and that they can be used for static analysis by AV solutions. We then went over the structures and fields we need to look at to resolve a module manually similar to `GetModuleHandle()`. Finally, we did take a look at resolving a function using a function name and a pointer to the module in memory as done by `GetProcAddress()`. Finally, we briefly mentioned the need for obfuscating the function names, that we want to resolve. The structures seen in this post will be relevant again in the following posts.
